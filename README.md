How to Run the Project

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Create an Azure Web App and deploy the project files to it.
    Create an Azure SQL flexible server and import all the dump files in the "dump" folder into your database.
    Update the database connection details in the database.php file to match your Azure SQL server credentials.
    Access the web app URL to use the library management system.

To create an Azure Web App and deploy the project files to it, you can follow these steps:

    Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
    Click on "Create a resource" button in the left menu, then select "Web App" under "Web + Mobile".
    Fill in the required information, such as the subscription, resource group, name of the web app, and operating system.
    Under "Publish", select "Code" and then choose your preferred deployment method. You can use FTP/S, GitHub, or Azure DevOps.
    If you choose FTP/S, you will need to configure the FTP/S settings for the web app in the Azure portal.
    Once the web app is created, you can deploy your project files by uploading them through the deployment method you chose.
    After the deployment is complete, you can access the web app through its URL in the Azure portal

    Note: You will also need to create an Azure SQL Database and update the database connection details in the project files to connect to the database. You can follow the instructions on the Azure portal to create the SQL Database and obtain the connection details.

To create an Azure SQL flexible server and import all the dump files in the "dump" folder into your database, follow these steps:

    Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com).
    Click on "Create a resource" in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
    Search for "Azure SQL" and select "Azure SQL flexible server" from the results.
    Click "Create" to begin creating the server.
    Fill out the required information, such as server name, admin username and password, and location.
    Choose the appropriate pricing tier and click "Review + create" to review your selections.
    Click "Create" to create the server.
    Once the server is created, click on the "Firewalls and virtual networks" tab and add your IP address to the firewall rules.
    Next, click on "Query editor (preview)" in the left-hand menu.
    Connect to your database using the server name, admin username and password, and the database name you created earlier.
    Upload the dump files from the "dump" folder using the "Import Data-tier Application" feature in the query editor.
    Once the import is complete, you can connect to the database using the database connection details in the "database.php" file of your project.
